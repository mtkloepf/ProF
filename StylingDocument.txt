Includes:
The list of includes should start with the Qt classes first, followed by all
project created classes -- separated by a newline. All includes should be in
alphabetical order.
Example:
#include <QObject>
#include <QWidget>

#include "myfile.h"
#include "myotherfile.h"


Headers:
The list of functions should be in the order of:
    public: (functions)
    protected: (functions)
    private: (functions)
    public slots:
    private slots:
    signals:
    public: (data)
    protected: (data)
    private: (data)
Data of the same type should be kept together


General guidelines:
No lines should exceed 80 characters (the function comment blocks are 80
for reference)

Retrieval/set functions should be kept together without newlines between them
and in that particular order (retrieval first, set second). They should be
implemented in the .cpp in the same order as listed in the .h
There should be two newlines between each set of retrieval/set functions

Simple functions that are described fully by the /brief do not need further
detail

Data of the same type should be listed in alphabetical order

In general, one newline between each function that is not get/set
